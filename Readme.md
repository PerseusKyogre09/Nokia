# Nokia Interface Project
This project recreates a nostalgic Nokia phone interface using Python's pygame library. It includes a number pad, call functionality, and classic Nokia aesthetics.

## Current Features
- Number Pad: A functional number pad with buttons for numbers 0-9, *, and #.
- Call Functionality: Users can enter a number and press the "Call" button to simulate making a call. The interface will show a "Calling..." message and display a contact image. The call state also plays the calling.mp3 audio file.
- Select Button: The "Select" button triggers the classic Nokia ringtone sound.
- Disconnect Button: Users can press the "Disconnect" button to end the call and return the interface to its idle state.
- Authentic Nokia Design: The interface is styled with a nostalgic Nokia wallpaper, button icons, and Nokia-like buttons.
